# TiddlyLisp in JS

An implimentation of [Lisp as the Maxwellâ€™s equations of software](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/)
in Javascript intead of Python.

## Usage

In git directory.

##### Open REPL

```
node main.js
```

##### Open REPL with loaded file(s)

```
node main.js /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2
```

## Still needs to be done

- Add test coverage in JS (`lisp.core` has tests that run when the repl is initialized)
- Add argument destructuring (at least to allow `(lambda (x y & rest) ... )`)
- Add the `'` syntax sugar
- Support for comments: `;`
- A `let` form that is like using `begin` and `define`, but introduces new scope.
